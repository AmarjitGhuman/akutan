// Package parser implements a parser combinator for the akutan query language.
// After parsing a query string into a query object, it is passed to the
// planner for a cost based evaluation of possible execution paths and finally
// the executor where the retrieval and join operations on the best plan are
// performed.
//
// For documentation on the query language specifics; see the root README.md.
